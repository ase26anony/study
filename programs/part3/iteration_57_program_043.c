This code appears to be from a compiler's reload pass, specifically handling different types of reload operations. Here's a breakdown:

## Context
This is part of a switch statement that determines where to store reload instructions based on the type of reload operation being performed. The variable `where` is being set to point to different instruction lists.

## Reload Types Explained

1. **`RELOAD_OTHER`** - General reloads not tied to specific operands
   - Goes to `other_input_reload_insns`

2. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPUT`** - Reloads for input operands
   - Goes to `input_reload_insns[rl->opnum]` (indexed by operand number)

3. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPUT_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of input operands
   - Goes to `input_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

4. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPADDR_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of input address reloads
   - Goes to `inpaddr_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

5. **`RELOAD_FOR_OUTPUT_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of output operands
   - Goes to `output_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

6. **`RELOAD_FOR_OUTADDR_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of output address reloads
   - Goes to `outaddr_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

7. **`RELOAD_FOR_OPERAND_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for operand addresses
   - Goes to `operand_reload_insns`

8. **`RELOAD_FOR_OPADDR_ADDR`** - Reloads for operand address addresses
   - Goes to `other_operand_reload_insns`

9. **`RELOAD_FOR_OTHER_ADDRESS`** - Other address reloads
   - Goes to `other_input_address_reload_insns`

## Purpose
The reload pass in compilers (like GCC) handles situations where operands need to be moved between registers and memory. This code organizes reload instructions into different categories so they can be inserted at appropriate places in the instruction stream during code generation.

The `rl->opnum` refers to the operand number in the instruction being processed, allowing the reload machinery to track which reloads correspond to which operands.
