This code appears to be from a compiler's reload pass (likely GCC), specifically handling different types of reload operations. Here's what each case does:

## Overview
The code determines where to store reload instructions based on the type of reload operation being performed. Each case sets `where` to point to a different array/location where the generated reload instructions should be stored.

## Case Breakdown

1. **`RELOAD_OTHER`** - General reloads not tied to specific operands
   - Stores in `other_input_reload_insns`

2. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPUT`** - Reloads for input operands
   - Stores in `input_reload_insns[rl->opnum]` (indexed by operand number)

3. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPUT_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of input operands
   - Stores in `input_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

4. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPADDR_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of input address reloads (nested addressing)
   - Stores in `inpaddr_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

5. **`RELOAD_FOR_OUTPUT_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of output operands
   - Stores in `output_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

6. **`RELOAD_FOR_OUTADDR_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of output address reloads
   - Stores in `outaddr_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

7. **`RELOAD_FOR_OPERAND_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for operand addresses
   - Stores in `operand_reload_insns`

8. **`RELOAD_FOR_OPADDR_ADDR`** - Reloads for operand address addresses
   - Stores in `other_operand_reload_insns`

9. **`RELOAD_FOR_OTHER_ADDRESS`** - Other address-related reloads
   - Stores in `other_input_address_reload_insns`

## Purpose
This organization allows the compiler to:
- Keep track of different categories of reload instructions separately
- Properly order reloads during instruction emission
- Handle complex addressing modes that may require multiple levels of reloads
- Distinguish between reloads for values vs. reloads for addresses

The `gcc_unreachable()` at the end ensures that all valid reload types are handled, providing a safety check during compilation.
