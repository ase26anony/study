This code appears to be from GCC's reload pass, specifically handling where to store reload instructions based on their purpose. Here's a breakdown:

## Purpose
This switch statement determines which array/pointer should receive reload instructions based on the type of reload being performed.

## Reload Types Explained

1. **`RELOAD_OTHER`** - General reloads not tied to specific operands
   - Goes to `other_input_reload_insns`

2. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPUT`** - Reloads for input operands
   - Goes to `input_reload_insns[rl->opnum]` (indexed by operand number)

3. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPUT_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of input operands
   - Goes to `input_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

4. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPADDR_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of input address reloads (nested addressing)
   - Goes to `inpaddr_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

5. **`RELOAD_FOR_OUTPUT_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of output operands
   - Goes to `output_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

6. **`RELOAD_FOR_OUTADDR_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of output address reloads
   - Goes to `outaddr_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

7. **`RELOAD_FOR_OPERAND_ADDRESS`** - General operand address reloads
   - Goes to `operand_reload_insns`

8. **`RELOAD_FOR_OPADDR_ADDR`** - Address reloads for operand address reloads
   - Goes to `other_operand_reload_insns`

9. **`RELOAD_FOR_OTHER_ADDRESS`** - Other address reloads
   - Goes to `other_input_address_reload_insns`

## Key Points
- The `rl->opnum` field contains the operand number for operand-specific reloads
- This separation allows GCC to properly order reload instructions during code generation
- Different reload types need to be emitted at different points in the instruction stream
- The `gcc_unreachable()` handles any unexpected reload types (should never happen in valid code)

This is part of GCC's register allocation infrastructure, specifically the reload pass that handles cases where the register allocator couldn't satisfy all constraints directly.
