This code appears to be from a compiler's reload pass (likely GCC), specifically handling different types of reload operations. Here's what each case does:

## Overview
The code determines where to store reload instructions based on the type of reload operation (`rl->when_needed`). Each case assigns a pointer `where` to a different array/location where the reload instructions should be inserted.

## Case Breakdown

1. **`RELOAD_OTHER`** - General reloads not tied to specific operands
   - Goes to `other_input_reload_insns`

2. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPUT`** - Reloads for input operands
   - Goes to `input_reload_insns[rl->opnum]` (indexed by operand number)

3. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPUT_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of input operands
   - Goes to `input_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

4. **`RELOAD_FOR_INPADDR_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of input address reloads (nested addressing)
   - Goes to `inpaddr_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

5. **`RELOAD_FOR_OUTPUT_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of output operands
   - Goes to `output_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

6. **`RELOAD_FOR_OUTADDR_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for addresses of output address reloads
   - Goes to `outaddr_address_reload_insns[rl->opnum]`

7. **`RELOAD_FOR_OPERAND_ADDRESS`** - Reloads for operand addresses
   - Goes to `operand_reload_insns`

8. **`RELOAD_FOR_OPADDR_ADDR`** - Reloads for operand address addresses
   - Goes to `other_operand_reload_insns`

9. **`RELOAD_FOR_OTHER_ADDRESS`** - Other address reloads
   - Goes to `other_input_address_reload_insns`

## Purpose
This is part of the reload phase in a compiler's backend, which handles:
- Moving values between registers and memory
- Ensuring operands are in the right locations for instructions
- Handling addressing modes and complex memory operations

The different arrays allow the compiler to keep track of where to insert reload instructions at different points in the instruction stream, ensuring they happen in the correct order relative to other operations.
