This is a switch statement that counts different types of something (likely data types in a compiler or analyzer). Here's what each case does:

1. **TYPE_UNDEFINED**: Increments counter for undefined types
2. **TYPE_SCALAR**: Increments counter for scalar types (integers, floats, etc.)
3. **TYPE_STRING**: Increments counter for string types
4. **TYPE_STRUCT**: Increments counter for regular struct types
5. **TYPE_USER_STRUCT**: Increments counter for user-defined struct types
6. **TYPE_UNION**: Increments counter for union types
7. **TYPE_POINTER**: Increments counter for pointer types
8. **TYPE_ARRAY**: Increments counter for array types
9. **TYPE_CALLBACK**: Increments counter for callback/function types
10. **TYPE_LANG_STRUCT**: Increments counter for language-specific struct types
11. **TYPE_NONE**: Calls `gcc_unreachable()` - a GCC builtin that indicates this code path should never be reached

The code appears to be part of a type classification or statistics collection system, possibly in a compiler frontend or static analyzer. Each type category has its own counter variable (`nb_` prefix suggests "number of" in French/English).
