This appears to be code from a C/C++ compiler (likely GCC) that's copying various attributes from one declaration (`decl`) to another (`to`). These are all tree node attributes in GCC's intermediate representation. Here's what each line does:

1. **`DECL_PRESERVE_P (to) = DECL_PRESERVE_P (decl);`**
   - Copies whether the declaration should be preserved (not optimized away)

2. **`DECL_CONTEXT (to) = DECL_CONTEXT (decl);`**
   - Copies the context/scope where the declaration appears (e.g., which function, class, or namespace)

3. **`TREE_USED (to) = TREE_USED (decl);`**
   - Copies whether the tree node has been referenced/used

4. **`TREE_PUBLIC (to) = TREE_PUBLIC (decl);`**
   - Copies whether the symbol has external linkage (visible outside the translation unit)

5. **`DECL_EXTERNAL (to) = DECL_EXTERNAL (decl);`**
   - Copies whether this is an external declaration (defined elsewhere)

6. **`DECL_COMMON (to) = DECL_COMMON (decl);`**
   - Copies whether this is a common symbol (C-style tentative definition)

7. **`DECL_WEAK (to) = DECL_WEAK (decl);`**
   - Copies whether this is a weak symbol (can be overridden by strong definitions)

8. **`DECL_VISIBILITY (to) = DECL_VISIBILITY (decl);`**
   - Copies the visibility attribute (default, hidden, protected, internal)

9. **`DECL_VISIBILITY_SPECIFIED (to) = DECL_VISIBILITY_SPECIFIED (decl);`**
   - Copies whether visibility was explicitly specified

10. **`DECL_DLLIMPORT_P (to) = DECL_DLLIMPORT_P (decl);`**
    - Copies whether this is a DLL import (Windows-specific)

This pattern is typical in compiler code when creating a copy or clone of a declaration while preserving all its attributes. The context suggests this might be from a function that duplicates declarations during optimization, inlining, or template instantiation.
