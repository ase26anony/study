This code appears to be part of a comparison function for a `double_int` class or struct that represents a double-width integer (likely 128-bit). Here's what it does:

## Code Analysis

1. **Reference to current object**: `const double_int &a = *this;` creates a reference `a` to the current object for easier access.

2. **High part comparison**: Compares the high 64-bit parts as unsigned integers:
   - First checks if `a.high < b.high` (unsigned comparison)
   - Then checks if `a.high > b.high` (unsigned comparison)

3. **Low part comparison**: Only if the high parts are equal, compares the low 64-bit parts:
   - Checks if `a.low < b.low`
   - Checks if `a.low > b.low`

## Return Values
- Returns `-1` if `a < b`
- Returns `1` if `a > b`
- Returns `0` if `a == b` (though the return 0 case isn't shown in this snippet)

## Purpose
This implements a standard lexicographic comparison for multi-precision integers, treating them as unsigned numbers. The high part is compared first because it's more significant in determining the overall value.

## Complete Function
The full function would likely look like:
```cpp
int compare(const double_int& b) const {
  const double_int &a = *this;
  if ((unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) a.high < (unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) b.high)
    return -1;
  if ((unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) a.high > (unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) b.high)
    return 1;
  if (a.low < b.low)
    return -1;
  if (a.low > b.low)
    return 1;
  return 0;  // equal
}
```

This pattern is common in compiler code (GCC/LLVM) for comparing wide integers used in constant folding and optimization.
