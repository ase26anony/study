This code appears to be part of a comparison function for a `double_int` class or struct that represents a double-width integer (likely 128-bit). Here's what it does:

## Code Analysis

1. **Reference to current object**: `const double_int &a = *this;` creates a reference `a` to the current object for easier access.

2. **High part comparison**: 
   - First compares the high 64-bit parts as **unsigned integers**
   - If `a.high < b.high`, returns `-1` (a < b)
   - If `a.high > b.high`, returns `1` (a > b)

3. **Low part comparison**:
   - Only reaches this point if high parts are equal
   - Compares the low 64-bit parts
   - If `a.low < b.low`, returns `-1` (a < b)
   - If `a.low > b.low`, returns `1` (a > b)

## What it returns:
- `-1`: Current object (`*this`) is less than `b`
- `0`: Current object equals `b` (implicitly, if neither function returns)
- `1`: Current object is greater than `b`

## Important Detail:
The high parts are compared as **unsigned integers** (`(unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT)`), which suggests this is implementing an **unsigned 128-bit integer comparison**. If this were for signed comparison, the high part comparison would need to handle sign bits differently.

## Complete function would look like:
```cpp
int double_int::compare(const double_int &b) const {
  const double_int &a = *this;
  if ((unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) a.high < (unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) b.high)
    return -1;
  if ((unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) a.high > (unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) b.high)
    return 1;
  if (a.low < b.low)
    return -1;
  if (a.low > b.low)
    return 1;
  return 0;  // Equal
}
```

This is a typical pattern for comparing multi-word integers, comparing from most significant to least significant part.
