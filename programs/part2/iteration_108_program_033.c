This code appears to be from a compiler (likely GCC) that's transforming comparison operations into bitwise operations. Let me explain what's happening:

## Context
This is part of a code transformation that converts relational comparisons (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) into equivalent bitwise operations, probably for optimization or to handle certain data types.

## The Transformations

### For `GT_EXPR` (Greater Than, `>`):
- `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- `bitop2 = BIT_AND_EXPR` (bitwise AND)
- No swapping of operands

### For `GE_EXPR` (Greater Than or Equal, `>=`):
- `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- `bitop2 = BIT_IOR_EXPR` (bitwise OR)
- No swapping of operands

### For `LT_EXPR` (Less Than, `<`):
- `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- `bitop2 = BIT_AND_EXPR` (bitwise AND)
- **Swaps** `cond_expr0` and `cond_expr1` using `std::swap`

### For `LE_EXPR` (Less Than or Equal, `<=`):
- `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- `bitop2 = BIT_IOR_EXPR` (bitwise OR)
- **Swaps** `cond_expr0` and `cond_expr1` using `std::swap`

## Pattern
The code shows a symmetry:
- `GT_EXPR` and `LT_EXPR` both use `BIT_AND_EXPR`
- `GE_EXPR` and `LE_EXPR` both use `BIT_IOR_EXPR`
- The "less than" variants (`LT_EXPR` and `LE_EXPR`) swap the operands

This suggests the transformation is using De Morgan's laws or similar bitwise logic equivalences. For example:
- `a > b` might be transformed to `~(a & b)` or similar
- `a < b` becomes `~(b & a)` after swapping (which is equivalent to `~(a & b)`)

## Purpose
This kind of transformation is often used:
1. **For vector/SIMD operations** where bitwise operations are faster than comparisons
2. **For boolean logic optimization** in expression trees
3. **For specific hardware architectures** that favor bitwise operations
4. **In compiler middle-end optimizations** to normalize expressions

The exact mathematical equivalence would depend on how the original comparison is being represented in bitwise form (likely using two's complement arithmetic or specific bit patterns).
