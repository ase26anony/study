This code appears to be cleanup/deallocation code from a scheduler in a compiler (likely GCC). Let me break down what each part does:

1. **`if (targetm.sched.free_sched_context)`** - If the target machine has a function to free scheduler context, call it with `save->be_saved_data` (backend saved data).

2. **`if (current_sched_info->restore_state)`** - If the current scheduler info has a restore_state function, free the `save->fe_saved_data` (frontend saved data).

3. **`for (i = 0; i <= max_insn_queue_index; i++)`** - Loop through all instruction queue indices and free the instruction lists at each position.

4. **`free (save->insn_queue)`** - Free the instruction queue array itself.

5. **`free (save->curr_state)`** - Free the current state data.

6. **`free (save->ready.vec)`** - Free the ready list vector.

7. **`free (save)`** - Finally, free the main save structure itself.

This is typical cleanup code for a saved scheduler state, likely used when restoring or discarding a checkpointed scheduler state. The code handles both target-specific (backend) and generic (frontend) scheduler data, along with various scheduler data structures like instruction queues and ready lists.
