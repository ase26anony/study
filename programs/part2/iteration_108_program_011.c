This code appears to be from a compiler (likely GCC) that's transforming comparison operations into bitwise operations. Let me break down what's happening:

## Context
This is part of a code transformation where comparison expressions (`GT_EXPR`, `GE_EXPR`, `LT_EXPR`, `LE_EXPR`) are being converted to equivalent bitwise operations.

## What each case does:

### `GT_EXPR` (Greater Than)
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_AND_EXPR` (bitwise AND)
- No swap of operands

### `GE_EXPR` (Greater Than or Equal)
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_IOR_EXPR` (bitwise OR)
- No swap of operands

### `LT_EXPR` (Less Than)
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_AND_EXPR` (bitwise AND)
- **Swaps** `cond_expr0` and `cond_expr1` using `std::swap`

### `LE_EXPR` (Less Than or Equal)
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_IOR_EXPR` (bitwise OR)
- **Swaps** `cond_expr0` and `cond_expr1` using `std::swap`

## Pattern
The code shows a symmetry:
- `GT_EXPR` and `LT_EXPR` both use `BIT_AND_EXPR`
- `GE_EXPR` and `LE_EXPR` both use `BIT_IOR_EXPR`
- The "less than" variants (`LT_EXPR`, `LE_EXPR`) swap the operands

This suggests the transformation is using De Morgan's laws or similar logical equivalences to rewrite comparisons in terms of bitwise operations, likely for optimization or to handle specific hardware/instruction sets.

## Mathematical Equivalence
For example:
- `a > b` might be transformed to `~(a & b)` or similar pattern
- `a < b` becomes `b > a` after swapping, then same transformation as `GT_EXPR`

This is likely part of a compiler's middle-end optimization pass that converts comparison operations to bitwise operations when beneficial for the target architecture.
