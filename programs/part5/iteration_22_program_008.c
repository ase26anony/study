This code appears to be part of a compiler optimization pass that transforms comparison operations into bitwise operations. Let me analyze what's happening:

## Context
This is likely from GCC or another C/C++ compiler's middle-end optimization phase, where it's converting relational comparisons into equivalent bitwise operations for optimization purposes.

## What the code does:

### For `GT_EXPR` (greater than):
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_AND_EXPR` (bitwise AND)
- No swap of operands

### For `GE_EXPR` (greater than or equal):
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_IOR_EXPR` (bitwise OR)
- No swap of operands

### For `LT_EXPR` (less than):
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_AND_EXPR` (bitwise AND)
- **Swaps** `cond_expr0` and `cond_expr1`

### For `LE_EXPR` (less than or equal):
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_IOR_EXPR` (bitwise OR)
- **Swaps** `cond_expr0` and `cond_expr1`

## Pattern Analysis:
The code is exploiting mathematical relationships:
- `a > b` is equivalent to `!(a <= b)` 
- `a >= b` is equivalent to `!(a < b)`
- `a < b` is equivalent to `b > a` (hence the swap)
- `a <= b` is equivalent to `b >= a` (hence the swap)

## Likely Transformation:
This is probably transforming comparisons like:
- `(a > b)` → `!(a & b)` or similar pattern
- `(a >= b)` → `!(a | b)` or similar pattern

The actual transformation would use `bitop1` and `bitop2` to build new expressions that are mathematically equivalent but potentially more efficient for certain architectures or optimization passes.
