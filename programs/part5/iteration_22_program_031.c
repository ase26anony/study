This code appears to be from a compiler (likely GCC) that's transforming comparison operations into bitwise operations. Let me explain what's happening:

## Context
This is part of a compiler optimization pass that converts comparison expressions into bitwise operations, probably for vectorization or SIMD operations.

## What each case does:

### `GT_EXPR` (Greater Than)
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_AND_EXPR` (bitwise AND)
- No swap of operands

### `GE_EXPR` (Greater Than or Equal)
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_IOR_EXPR` (bitwise OR)
- No swap of operands

### `LT_EXPR` (Less Than)
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_AND_EXPR` (bitwise AND)
- **Swaps** `cond_expr0` and `cond_expr1` using `std::swap`

### `LE_EXPR` (Less Than or Equal)
- Sets `bitop1 = BIT_NOT_EXPR` (bitwise NOT)
- Sets `bitop2 = BIT_IOR_EXPR` (bitwise OR)
- **Swaps** `cond_expr0` and `cond_expr1` using `std::swap`

## Pattern
The code shows a symmetry:
- `GT_EXPR` and `LT_EXPR` both use `BIT_AND_EXPR`
- `GE_EXPR` and `LE_EXPR` both use `BIT_IOR_EXPR`
- The "less than" variants (`LT_EXPR` and `LE_EXPR`) swap the operands

This suggests the compiler is using De Morgan's laws or similar transformations to convert comparisons into equivalent bitwise operations, likely for operations on vector/mask registers where comparisons produce bit masks.
