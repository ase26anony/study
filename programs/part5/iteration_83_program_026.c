This code appears to be part of a comparison function (likely `operator<` or `compare`) for a `double_int` class or struct that represents a double-width integer (likely 128-bit). Here's what it does:

## Code Analysis

1. **Reference to current object**: `const double_int &a = *this;` creates a reference `a` to the current object for easier access.

2. **High part comparison (unsigned)**: 
   - First compares the high parts as unsigned integers
   - If `a.high < b.high`, returns `-1` (a < b)
   - If `a.high > b.high`, returns `1` (a > b)

3. **Low part comparison (unsigned)**:
   - Only reaches this point if high parts are equal
   - Compares the low parts
   - If `a.low < b.low`, returns `-1` (a < b)
   - If `a.low > b.low`, returns `1` (a > b)

4. **Implicit return**: If neither condition is met (both high and low parts are equal), the function would return `0` (a == b), though that return statement isn't shown in this snippet.

## Likely Context

This is probably from GCC or LLVM source code, where `HOST_WIDE_INT` is typically `long` or `long long` (64-bit on modern systems), making `double_int` a 128-bit integer type.

## Complete Function Example

The full function would look something like:
```cpp
int double_int::compare(const double_int &b) const {
  const double_int &a = *this;
  if ((unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) a.high < (unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) b.high)
    return -1;
  if ((unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) a.high > (unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) b.high)
    return 1;
  if (a.low < b.low)
    return -1;
  if (a.low > b.low)
    return 1;
  return 0;  // equal
}
```

This implements a lexicographic comparison treating the double-width integer as an unsigned value (high part most significant, low part least significant).
