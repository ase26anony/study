This code appears to be part of a comparison function for a `double_int` class or struct that represents a double-width integer (likely 128-bit). Here's what it does:

## Code Analysis

1. **Reference to current object**: `const double_int &a = *this;` creates a reference `a` to the current object for easier access.

2. **High part comparison (unsigned)**: 
   - First compares the high parts as unsigned integers
   - If `a.high < b.high`, returns -1 (a < b)
   - If `a.high > b.high`, returns 1 (a > b)

3. **Low part comparison (signed)**:
   - If high parts are equal, compares the low parts
   - If `a.low < b.low`, returns -1 (a < b)
   - If `a.low > b.low`, returns 1 (a > b)

## Return Value Convention
- **-1**: Current object (`*this`) is less than `b`
- **0**: Objects are equal (implicit - returns 0 if none of the conditions match)
- **1**: Current object (`*this`) is greater than `b`

## Interesting Points
- The high part is compared as `unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT` while the low part appears to be compared as signed (no cast shown)
- This suggests the high part might contain sign information or be treated differently
- This is likely implementing a total ordering for a multi-precision integer

## Complete Function
The full comparison function would probably look like:
```cpp
int double_int::compare(const double_int &b) const {
  const double_int &a = *this;
  if ((unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) a.high < (unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) b.high)
    return -1;
  if ((unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) a.high > (unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT) b.high)
    return 1;
  if (a.low < b.low)
    return -1;
  if (a.low > b.low)
    return 1;
  return 0;  // equal
}
```

This is a common pattern for comparing multi-word integers where you compare from most significant to least significant parts.
