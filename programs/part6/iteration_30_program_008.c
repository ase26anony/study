This code appears to be from the GCC compiler's scheduler, specifically cleaning up saved scheduling state. Here's what each part does:

1. **`if (targetm.sched.free_sched_context)`** - If the target machine has a function to free scheduler context, call it with the saved backend data.

2. **`if (current_sched_info->restore_state)`** - If the current scheduler info has a restore_state function, free the frontend saved data.

3. **`for (i = 0; i <= max_insn_queue_index; i++)`** - Loop through all instruction queue entries and free the INSN_LIST linked lists.

4. **`free (save->insn_queue)`** - Free the array that holds the instruction queues.

5. **`free (save->curr_state)`** - Free the current scheduler state.

6. **`free (save->ready.vec)`** - Free the ready list vector (instructions ready for scheduling).

7. **`free (save)`** - Finally free the main save structure itself.

This is typical cleanup code for a scheduling context save/restore mechanism in GCC's instruction scheduler, where `save` is a pointer to a structure containing all the scheduler state that needs to be preserved and later restored or cleaned up.
